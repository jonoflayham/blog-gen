Thank you, [Bryan Gilbert](https://github.com/gilbertw1/blog-gen), [Christian Johansen](https://github.com/cjohansen/cjohansen-no/blob/master/resources/md/building-static-sites-in-clojure-with-stasis.md) and other authors of the [Clojure](http://clojure.org) code behind this new blog.  I'm finding that understanding and using Clojure is a refreshing antidote to the current day job, which is dismayingly full of SOAP, Maven, Spring, things called Websphere.* and someone else's copy-and-paste Java.  Never mind!  Not for much longer, then I'm out into the warm sunlight of a new opportunity.
